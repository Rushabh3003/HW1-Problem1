# HW1-Problem1
Currently, I'm pursuing an online course by Harvard University. The name of the course is Data Science. This is the problem 1 of the first Homework.

Given below is the problem statement

Problem 1
In Lecture 1, we showed a plot that provided evidence that the 2002 and 2003 Oakland A's, a team that used data science, had a competitive advantage. Since, others teams have started using data science as well. Use exploratory data analysis to determine if the competitive advantage has since disappeared.

Problem 1(a)

Load in these CSV files from the Sean Lahman's Baseball Database. For this assignment, we will use the 'Salaries.csv' and 'Teams.csv' tables. Read these tables into a pandas DataFrame and show the head of each table.

Problem 1(b)

Summarize the Salaries DataFrame to show the total salaries for each team for each year. Show the head of the new summarized DataFrame.

Problem 1(c)

Merge the new summarized Salaries DataFrame and Teams DataFrame together to create a new DataFrame showing wins and total salaries for each team for each year year. Show the head of the new merged DataFrame.

Problem 1(d)

How would you graphically display the relationship between total wins and total salaries for a given year? What kind of plot would be best? Choose a plot to show this relationship and specifically annotate the Oakland baseball team on the on the plot. Show this plot across multiple years. In which years can you detect a competitive advantage from the Oakland baseball team of using data science? When did this end?

Problem 1(e):

For AC209 Students: Fit a linear regression to the data from each year and obtain the residuals. Plot the residuals against time to detect patterns that support your answer in 1(d).
